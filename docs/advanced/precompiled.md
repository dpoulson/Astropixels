# Precompiled Binaries

There are a set of precompiled binaries available on the github repo that have some different colour schemes. You can use the Astropixels web installer here:

[Web Installer](https://dpoulson.github.io/Astropixels/)

This will allow you to flash any of the firmwares to your lights. A Chrome based browser is required (chrome, chromium, brave, etc.)

If you have any ideas for other custom firmwares that people may be interested in, drop me a line.
