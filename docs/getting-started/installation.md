# Installation

The Astropixel kit is designed to fit into the same surrounds as the old teecees lights with the same mounting holes. 

## Main Board

The main breakout board can be mounted on the back of the RLD with long enough screws and some spacers. This is probably the best/easiest mounting option and the cables supplied are designed around it being in this position

## Bezels

Here is a pdf to be used with a cnc or laser cutter to make some acrylic bezels and front covers for the logics

Joel Joannisse has also done some fantastic printable bezels that can be done with some clear petg (or others).

Here is what Joel says: 

```
Here are the Astropixels logic display with diffuser I been working on. It is for the MK4 dome. The difference here is that 
you screw the Astropixels board to the locking bar (using M3 6mm screws) of the Rear logic display instead of the RLD board it self. 

It's a multicolor print but its a single filament swap after the first layer. I use PETG (Transparent for the first 
layer, dark blue or black for the rest). You will need to use a 0.4 nozzle and print at 0.2 layer height. I print 
mine a bit hotter (265c) and print the first layer at 30mm/s. I included my Bambu Studio file with those settings. 

IMPORTANT. The bezel fits really snug over the LEDs but you could apply pressure on them if your screws are too tight. 
Turn your screw just tight enough so that nothing moves and you are good.

## Spacers

Here are a collection of STL files to 3d print for spacing the boards out from the surrounds and clear front cover. Along with 3d printable bezels.

## HP Board mounts
Dana Jan has kindly done a dedicated HP light board mount for printed droids MK4 dome. You can find their updated files here:
