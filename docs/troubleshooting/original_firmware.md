# Original Firmware

If you have been messing with the firmware and want to go back to the basics, the example Astropixels sketch in the ReelTwo library is what is installed by default when they are shipped.

I have also created a web installer that you can use:

The standard firmware is what is shipped by default with all Astropixels.
